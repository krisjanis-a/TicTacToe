		{-} Tic-Tac-Toe Game {-}

Plan

1) Create Board
2) Ask player to make a move
2.1) Fill the board with player choice
3) Ask 2nd player/ AI to make move
3.1) Fill the board with player choice
4) Determine winner for having full 3 element line or game over because board is full
5) Add to winner's score and restart the game

<->

Get player input logic

Is the game finished/ board full?

If not, who's turn is it to make a move?

If choice is made, is the move legal?

If the move is not legal, make choice again.

If choice is legal, add choice to gameboard. Change active player and start logic again.
